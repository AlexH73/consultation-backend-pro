# Unit Tests – Review Session 🧪

This consultation was dedicated to **revising and reinforcing unit testing concepts**.
The topic was not new, but served as a reminder and structured repetition.

The examples are based on a simple `Calculator` class.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Session

- Refresh knowledge of unit testing principles
- Practice writing clean and readable tests
- Revisit JUnit annotations and test structure

---

## 🧱 AAA Principle

All tests follow the **AAA pattern**:

- **Arrange** – prepare test data and objects
- **Act** – execute the method under test
- **Assert** – verify the result

This structure improves readability and test maintainability.

## 🧪 JUnit Annotations Used

### Lifecycle Annotations

- `@BeforeEach` – executed before each test
- `@AfterEach` – executed after each test
- `@BeforeAll` – executed once before all tests
- `@AfterAll` – executed once after all tests

---

### Test Customization

- `@DisplayName` – provides readable test names in reports

---

## 📌 Notes

- Tests are located in `src/test`
- The focus is on clarity, not complexity
- This topic serves as a foundation for future testing scenarios

---

> Strong tests protect your code  
> even when requirements change.
